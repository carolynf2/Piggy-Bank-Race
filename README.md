# Piggy-Bank-Race

Core Concept

Kids choose a savings goal (like a toy, game, or special outing) and race to fill their virtual piggy bank by making smart financial choices and completing activities.

Game Mechanics

Goal Selection:

Choose from preset goals with different price points ($10 toy, $25 video game, $50 bike, $100 tablet)

Each goal shows a picture and explains why saving for it is worthwhile

Visual progress bar shows how close they are to their target

Earning Money:

Daily Allowance: Receive small amounts regularly (teaches routine saving)

Chore Completion: Extra earnings for virtual household tasks

Smart Choices: Bonus money for choosing "save" over "spend" in scenarios

Mini-Games: Quick activities like coin counting or price comparison for small rewards


Spending Decisions:

Present regular temptations: "Ice cream truck is here! Spend $2 or save it?"

Show immediate vs. delayed gratification consequences

"If you save this $2, you'll reach your goal 2 days sooner!"

Visual Elements:

Animated piggy bank that gets fuller and happier as money is added

Celebration animations when milestones are reached (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

Calendar showing estimated completion date that updates with each decision

Comparison with other "racers" (AI characters) working toward their own goals

Educational Features:

Simple interest simulation: "Your $20 earned 50Â¢ this week!"

Opportunity cost lessons: "Buying candy means 3 fewer days to your goal"

Progress celebrations that reinforce positive saving habits

Completion Rewards:

Virtual "purchase" ceremony with confetti and sounds
